Her athletic career was almost imminent, as she was born into a family of stellar athletes. Her father played professional soccer for Poland and Denmark, and her mother played volleyball for the Polish national team. Along with natural athletic ability and passion for the sport of tennis, Caroline has a calm, cheerful disposition, which quickly helped shape her reputation on the pro tour.\n\nCaroline started playing tennis at age 7, and by the time she was 9, she was beating her parents and older brother. In 2005 at the young age of 15, Caroline turned pro and began her career on the WTA tour. In 2006, while still 15, Caroline made the junior singles final at the Australian Open, the junior doubles final at Roland Garros and later won the junior singles title at Wimbledon. She also won her first pro tournament, an ITF event, and made the quarterfinals at two other WTA events.\n\nCaroline played her first full season on tour in 2007, cracking the Top 100 for the first time and finishing the year ranked #64. In 2008, she won the first three tour titles of her career, made the fourth rounds of the Australian and U.S. Opens, and finished the season with a #12 ranking. She added three more titles to her name in 2009, made the fourth round of Wimbledon in addition to the final of the U.S. Open, and ended the year ranked #4. Before Wozniacki, no Danish player—male or female—had ever cracked the top 30 rankings. Going into the 2010 season, Caroline’s game was red hot and she was able to notch another 6 WTA titles and finished the year in the #1 ranking, later keeping the that top spot for 67 straight weeks. In 2011, Wozniacki won another six WTA titles and recorded a WTA-leading 63 match wins. Caroline also added two more WTA titles to her resume during the 2012 season (Korea Open, Kremlin Cup), one title in 2013 in Luxembourg, and Istanbul in 2014.\n\nAt only the young age of 24, Caroline has accomplished what many athletes only dream of, winning a stellar 22 WTA tour titles and holding the #1 ranking spot for two consecutive seasons (2010, 2011). With exceptional tour experience behind her, Caroline is back in the top five and hopes to continue to stay at the top of the WTA rankings for many seasons to come.","html":"<p>Caroline Wozniacki was born on July 11, 1990 in Denmark.
