She has been a champion and the world’s top ranked player on the court, while also transcending the game off of it with her diverse background and off the court interests, which include fashion, acting, music, and philanthropy.\n\nCaroline was born into a family of athletes on July 11, 1990, in Odense, Denmark. Her father, a former professional football player in Poland and Denmark, and mother, a former member of the Polish national volleyball team, gave Caroline advice that has propelled her to her current success: Believe in yourself. Their guidance combined with Caroline’s natural athletic ability, cheerful disposition and passion for the sport of tennis positioned her to embark on a prosperous career.\n\nCaroline’s competitive spirit is another trait inherited from her family. At the age of 7, Caroline began playing tennis and by 9 was beating her parents and older brother, Patrik. She began her professional career on the WTA tour by age 15 and one year later made the junior singles final at the Australian Open, the junior doubles final at Roland Garros and won the junior singles title at Wimbledon. 2006 was an exciting year, as she also won her first pro tournament, an ITF event, and made the quarterfinals at two other WTA events.\n\nCaroline played her first full season on tour in 2007, cracking the Top 100 for the first time and finishing the year ranked #64. In 2008, she won the first three tour titles of her career, made the fourth rounds of the Australian and U.S. Opens, and finished the season ranked No. #12 in the world. She added three more titles to her name in 2009, made the fourth round of Wimbledon in addition to the final of the U.S. Open, and ended the year ranked #4. Before Wozniacki, no Danish player—male or female—had ever placed within the top 30 rankings. Going into the 2010 season, Caroline was able to notch another 6 WTA titles to finish the year in the #1 ranking, later keeping the top spot for 67 straight weeks. In 2011, Wozniacki won another six WTA titles and recorded a WTA-leading 63 match wins. Caroline also added two more WTA titles to her resume during the 2012 season (Korea Open, Kremlin Cup), one title in 2013 in Luxembourg, and another in Istanbul in 2014.\n\nOne of Caroline’s biggest off court accomplishments was completing the New York City Marathon in 2014, which she did in support of a children’s charity Team for Kids. She also enjoys dabbling in other sports such as soccer, boxing, football and baseball. Her expertise also extends beyond sports, as she takes piano lessons and practices speaking any one of the eight languages in her repertoire. She has been featured in Sports Illustrated’s famed Swimsuit issue in both 2015 and 2016, and has appeared in an episode of the hit HBO show Ballers alongside Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson. In her spare time, she loves attending fashion shows, singing karaoke with best friend Serena Williams, playing with her dog, Bruno, and reading or watching movies to relax.\n\nAt the young age of 26, Caroline has accomplished what many athletes only dream of, winning a stellar 25 WTA tour titles and holding the #1 ranking spot for two consecutive seasons (2010, 2011).  As of today, she remains the first Scandinavian woman to reach the #1 ranking spot in the WTA history. Although Caroline has a successful past, she lives by her quote, “Your true rival is yourself, and you can always improve.”  With that mindset, Caroline does not plan on slowing down any time soon and is ready to tackle the next steps in her career.","html":"<p>Caroline Wozniacki is one of the most recognizable female athletes in the world.

The Olympics really means a lot to me, and I have amazing memories from my previous two Olympic participations. I am enjoying being a part of the Danish team, and feeling the team spirit that I normally do not experience every day. To carry the flag in Rio will be one of the highpoints of my career and it will be something that I will never forget,” says Caroline Wozniacki.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Danish National Olympic Committees, Olympic-head of mission, Morten Rodtwitt, is looking forward to experiencing Caroline Wozniacki at the front of the Danish team.</p>\n\n<p>“Caroline is one of the most successful tennis players throughout the past ten years, and she has achieved results in a global type of sport where the completion is extremely tough. Furthermore, she has millions of fans around the world because of her smiling and forthcoming. Caroline is an amazing ambassador for Denmark, and therefore she is a female athlete that we would like to identify with, and be represented by,” says Morten Rodtwitt, and continues.</p>\n\n<p>“Caroline has previously participated in two Olympics, in Beijing and London, and both times she has truly acted as a team player. Being smiley and social and always interested in how the other athletes on the team are doing. There is always a positive mood where she is. Those are qualities that goes well with being a standard bearer”.</p>\n\n<p>Caroline Wozniackis primary job at the Olympics in Rio is however to deliver a good result in the tennis tournament, in 2008 she made it to the third round, while in 2012 she was knocked out in the quarter finals. Both times, she lost to the later Olympic champion. That she will be the Danish standard bearer will only strengthen her motivation to get even further in Rio.</p>\n\n<p>“The Olympics is my biggest goal in 2016, and I am really looking forward to it. It will be a different Caroline than at the previous two Olympics. I have more experience this time, and I know 100 percent what it is like to be at the Olympics, therefore I am confident in achieving a good result in Rio.” says Caroline Wozniacki.</p>","image":"/content/images/2016/11/standardbearer.jpg","featured":0,"page":0,"status":"published","language":"en_US","meta_title":null,"meta_description":null,"author_id":1,"created_at":1478828956946,"created_by":1,"updated_at":1478829711868,"updated_by":1,"published_at":1454723340000,"published_by":1,"visibility":"public","mobiledoc":null},{"id":41,"uuid":"be400114-f3b4-4258-b0c6-6830db2a0dc5","title":"Caroline Wozniacki Gets Painted for SI Swimsuit Issue","slug":"caroline-wozniacki-gets-painted-for-si-swimsuit-issue","markdown":"For the second consecutive year, Caroline Wozniacki is featured in the 2016 Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Edition which is on newsstands this week.
